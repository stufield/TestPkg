# The `Test` package


## Overview

Add general overview of the package here ...


----------------

## Installation

You can currently install `Test` directly from the command line:
```
R --vanilla CMD INSTALL Test
```

However, future local repositories will allow typical command from within R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Test")
```




## Usage

To load the `somaverse` simply make a call to `library()` as usual:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(Test)
```

## Notes about the package

* The `Test` package is easy to use.

* There is some cool stuff we can do.
